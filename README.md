# Project Title:Online-Exam-System
Online Exam System with Randomized Questions and Result Analytics:
An e-assessment system that dynamically generates unique question sets from a pool per
student. Questions are tagged by diƯiculty, topic, and type (MCQ, True/False). Real-time
monitoring tracks time spent on each question and behavioral flags (like rapid switching). After
submission, the system produces detailed reports with graphs on strong and weak areas,
comparing students’ performance anonymously.
